            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Norman, Oklahoma - home of the Norman Chocolate Festival.
                I guess that shaped my love for food, because my first word was "cookie" and
                I learned to open the refrigerator before I learned to walk.
            </p>
            <p>
                My family moved to Wichita when I was still a baby.
                When I was 10, we moved through a couple unremarkable small towns.
            </p>
            <p>
                My discovery of computers started with the basics - solitaire, minesweeper, SkiFree and
                a sweet cd-rom with about ten games on it that I got from the bargain bin at Staples and
                devoted many hours of my life to. Next came Warcraft - and lanning with my siblings...
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, with my introduction to the internet - Xanga, myspace, etc... I started learning basic html.
                My dance studio paid me to make them a website, despite my limited knowledge of what I was doing;
                and like most people my age, I quickly graduate into the role of tech support for my parents.

            <h2>School</h2>
            <p>
                I managed to convince my parents to let me attend college early at 16 at a special program for high school
                students at Northewst Missouri State University called the Missouri Academy of Science, Mathematics and Computing.
                Along with the other gen ed coursework, I took a couple semesters of Java.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went to a year of pre-med before deciding to change path. My passion for sustainability
                led me to completing a degree in Environmental Engineering from Missouri S&#38T in Rolla.

            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>
                I have spent seven years working as an Environmental Engineer. I am proud of the work I have done,
                and I remain passionate about sustainability and the environment, but I am excited to explore another
                path through programming. When I made my first "real" website for my dance studio back in early high
                school, I didn't actually expect to get paid. I was just a kid having fun on the computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days, I see so many opportunities to use programming to improve the way we manage and protect our natural resources.
                From modeling software for wastewater treatment facilities to using machine learning to aid in stormwater
                management, there are many opportunities to use the skills I'm learning now to promote the causes I am passionate about.
                While doing something I genuinely enjoy.
